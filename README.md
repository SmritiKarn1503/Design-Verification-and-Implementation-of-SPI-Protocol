# Design-Verification-and-Implementation-of-SPI-Protocol
This project focuses on the design, verification, and implementation of an SPI communication protocol. The project involves developing SPI master and slave modules in Verilog, creating a verification environment in System Verilog, and synthesizing the design on an FPGA using Xilinx Vivado. The final step is to validate the functionality by implementing the design on a target device.
