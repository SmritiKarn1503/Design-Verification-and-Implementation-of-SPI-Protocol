# Design-Verification-and-Implementation-of-SPI-Protocol
This project involves the design, verification, and implementation of the SPI protocol using Verilog and SystemVerilog/UVM. The design will be developed in AMD Vivado with a 1 MHz clock frequency and 9-bit data frame. Verification will be conducted in Mentor Graphics QuestaSim, utilizing SystemVerilog/UVM to ensure thorough coverage and reliability. The design will then be synthesized, implemented, and tested on a Digilent Basys 3 FPGA board to validate real-world performance. The project provides a complete flow from HDL design and verification to FPGA deployment, ensuring protocol functionality and robustness.
